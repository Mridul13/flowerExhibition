		The Honesty plant or money plant also goes by the name Lunaria. It is a biennial flower that produces circular seedheads that look like coins.
	</p>
	<p>
		The plant can grow up to 3 feet tall, and it self-seeds readily, so you donâ€™t have to do much work with it each year. Blossoms are purple or white.
